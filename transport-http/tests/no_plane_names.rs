//! A TRANSPORT IS A WIRE, NEVER A PLANE — asserted over this crate's own source and its own manifest.
//!
//! ## Why this test exists and why it is not a review note
//!
//! The mount in this crate serves any plane's declared surface. The whole value of that is that it
//! does not know which plane, and the whole value is lost the first time a protocol's name appears
//! here — one `if` on a dialect, one route spelled out because "it is only this one protocol", one
//! dependency added because a codec was convenient. Every one of those is a small, reasonable-looking
//! diff, and the thing they add up to is the coupling this generic mount exists to remove.
//!
//! A comment saying "do not name a plane here" is a comment. This runs.
//!
//! ## What is scanned, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! The crate's own `src/` tree and its own `Cargo.toml`. Both, because the two ways a protocol gets
//! into a transport are different in kind: a word in the source is a branch on a dialect, and a
//! dependency in the manifest is a codec in the closure, and neither implies the other.
//!
//! `[dev-dependencies]` is scanned too, and that is a decision worth stating. A transport's TESTS
//! may not reach for a plane either: a battery that proved the mount by driving one real protocol
//! through it would be a battery that proves the mount works for that protocol, which is the one
//! claim the mount does not make. The proof that a real protocol's bytes survive this mount belongs
//! where a real protocol may be named — the composition root — and it is asserted there.
//!
//! ## And no core, either
//!
//! The same file carries the second half of the tree's rule. **Core drives plugins; a plugin never
//! names core.** A transport that reached for the kernel, the capability types or the loop's own
//! entry point would be the axis that knows only bytes holding the machinery that knows what a unit
//! costs — and it is an easy thing to do by accident, because running the unit yourself is one
//! function call shorter than handing it across a seam. What a transport gets instead is a
//! `busbar_contract_transport::driver::UnitDriver`, handed to it at listen by the root that
//! implements it.
//!
//! So `busbar_kernel`, `busbar_caps` and `run_unit` are refused here beside the plane names, in the
//! source and in the manifest both.
//!
//! ## What counts as a plane name
//!
//! Two lists. The plane CRATE names, in both spellings a manifest and a source file use, and the
//! DIALECT words the architecture's own section 6 names. The dialect words are matched on word
//! boundaries: a transport is allowed the letters, just not the word.
