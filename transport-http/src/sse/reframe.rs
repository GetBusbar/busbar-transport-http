//! THE OUTBOUND MIRROR of the inbound carve: on the MOUNT side, turning one complete success
//! message — and any records that must precede it — into an event stream.
//!
//! [`super::carve_complete_frames`] does the inbound half: it re-segments a byte stream an upstream
//! sent AS an event stream into frames. This is the other direction. A served door that produced ONE
//! complete `200` answer, plus a run of records it wants delivered ahead of that answer, can offer
//! that same answer as an event stream instead of a single body — when, and only when, the caller
//! asked for one.
//!
//! ## Two pieces, both surface-neutral
//!
//! * [`prefers_event_stream`] reads the caller's `Accept` header and answers one question: did the
//!   caller PREFER an event stream? It is a q-value negotiation, not a substring test — a caller that
//!   lists `text/event-stream;q=0.1, application/json` asked for the body, and a caller that lists
//!   `text/event-stream` with no lower q asked for the stream.
//! * [`reframe`] lays the records out first, each as its own event, then the result as the last
//!   event — the "logs ahead of the result" ordering, so a consumer sees everything the door wanted
//!   it to see BEFORE the answer that ends the exchange.
//!
//! Neither piece is wired to anything: a mount consumes this only once a plane declares it wants the
//! reframe, so the transport is byte-for-byte unchanged until then.

/// The media type an event stream is served as.
const EVENT_STREAM: &str = "text/event-stream";

/// Does the caller PREFER an event stream over a single body?
///
/// Reads the `Accept` header as a list of media ranges, each with an optional `;q=` weight (default
/// `1.0`, per RFC 9110). The answer is yes when `text/event-stream` is named EXPLICITLY with a
/// non-zero weight at least as high as the best weight any concrete body range carries. A bare `*/*`
/// does not count as naming the event stream — a client that accepts anything has expressed no

// ── THE COMPOSITION-ROOT-OWNED SSE-REFRAME SEAM (HOST-CAPS S3, DECISIONS #26) ─────────────────────
//
// The server-side reframe above is TWO neutral free functions. This seam names that pair as ONE host
// capability a mount reaches through a trait object rather than by calling the free functions
// directly, so the composition root can install the reframer once at boot and a later pass swap the
// implementation WITHOUT the mount changing. ADDITIVE AND DORMANT: the production impl
// [`PassThroughReframe`] delegates to the exact free functions above, and NOTHING on the shipped path
// consults the seam yet — the transport is byte-for-byte unchanged until a mount opts in. The
// composition-root install ([`install_sse_reframe`]) mirrors the egress seam's `install_hostless_egress`.
