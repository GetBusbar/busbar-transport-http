//! The `sse` transport: one request, N response frames, composed over `http`.
//!
//! `sse` carries no session of its own; it inherits `http`'s per-frame `WireStatusClass` at the first
//! response frame, exactly as the design's composition rule states ("a composed transport
//! inherits the lower layer's status leg"). This crate does not open a socket itself: `dial`
//! delegates straight to an [`crate::HttpTransport`] it holds, and `frames`
//! re-segments the byte stream `http` already assembled at the SSE frame terminator (a blank
//! line), using the terminator scan [`proto`] carries — ported from the kernel's `proto` module per
//! the design's rule that a transport's own wire pieces live in the transport crate.
//!
//! The re-segmentation buffer is held to the design's per-connection reading budget
//! (`MAX_CURSOR_BYTES`). Upstream bytes are untrusted, and this is the one accumulator with no cap
//! a layer above it: the served door's request-body limit does not reach a streamed response body.
//! An upstream that opens an event stream and never writes a blank line ends it with `Framing`
//! rather than growing this buffer for the life of the connection.

/// tail once per frame, which is quadratic in the number of frames one buffer arrives holding — the
/// ordinary shape when an upstream flushes a batch of events in a single body.
