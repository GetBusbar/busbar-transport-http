/// The event-stream grammar names three: CRLF, a lone LF, and a lone CR. A CR at the very end of
/// the buffer is not yet knowable — the LF that would make it a CRLF may still be in flight — so it
/// reads as "no terminator here", which is the answer that makes a caller wait for more bytes
/// rather than split a CRLF down the middle.

/// this call examined — the pair a caller uses to pin the scan's own complexity class without a
/// process-global counter racing every other test in the binary. `None` when no complete blank line

/// All three of the spec's terminators are recognised, in every pairing: `\n\n` and `\r\n\r\n` are

/// The search jumps between CR and LF bytes rather than stepping every position; a terminator
/// begins with one of the two, so no candidate is skipped.
