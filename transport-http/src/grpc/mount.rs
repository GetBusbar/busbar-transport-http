//! MOUNTING A DECLARED SURFACE ON THE FRAMED BINDING: any plane's, and none of them by name.
//!
//! ## What is different here, and what is deliberately the same
//!
//! On the document transports an operation is addressed by its target or by a member of the posted
//! document. On this one it is addressed by a SERVICE DESCRIPTOR: a call's target is
//! `/{service}/{method}`, derived by the client from the descriptor rather than chosen, which is why
//! a declaration cannot write the path down and expect it to stay true. So this module owns exactly
//! two things the document mount does not — splitting a call's target into the two names, and
//! answering an unknown one the way this wire answers it — and reuses everything else.
//!
//! Everything else is [`crate::mount`]: the request view a plane reads facts
//! through, the frame, the seam where a mount leaves what arrived for the units that will read it,
//! and the loop drive. Writing a second copy of those here would be a second answer to how a unit is
//! run, and the two would disagree the first time one of them was fixed.
//!
//! ## The status column is the WIRE's, not the protocol's and not the kernel's
//!
//! [`status_of`] maps the driver's CLOSED outcome vocabulary onto this wire's status codes, and it
//! is the same mapping for every plane because it is a statement about what happened to the CALL:
//! nobody answered, the caller was not identified, the caller was identified and not permitted, the
//! node is shedding. It takes the closed vocabulary rather than the loop's own ending because an
//! ending carries a step, a reason code and a posting and this wire has a field for none of them —
//! and because a transport that named the loop's types would be a plugin naming core. A protocol
//! that wants finer words than these puts them in its own answer body, which is the plane's to
//! write and not this file's to know.
//!
//! ## No plane is named here
//!
//! Asserted, not asked for: `tests/no_plane_names.rs` scans this crate's source and its manifest.
