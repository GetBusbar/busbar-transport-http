//! The server side: one hyper HTTP/2 connection per accepted TCP socket, with a byte-blind
//! per-RPC handler that forwards inbound gRPC messages into the connection's shared inbound
//! channel and drains an outbound channel `write()` feeds, back onto the wire.
//!
//! ## The RPC path: the destination's, with this crate's own as the fallback
//!
//! gRPC's own wire format names every call by an HTTP/2 `:path` of the shape
//! `/package.Service/Method`. A dialled call uses the method the destination named — the
//! destination declares it under the reserved `method` key and `GrpcTransport::dial` reads it back
//! through `UpstreamAddress::extra`, ignoring every key it does not understand — so two plane
//! operations
//! on one transport can reach two upstream methods. Only a destination naming none falls back to
//! [`RPC_PATH`], which is also the path this byte-blind server answers on: served calls are
//! answered whatever `:path` they arrive with, since the transport reads no meaning from it beyond
//! recording it.
