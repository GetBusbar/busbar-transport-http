//! The `http` transport: request in, response frames out.
//!
//! `http` carries no session (`SESSION = false`) and its per-frame `WireStatusClass` rides the first
//! response frame (`STATUS_CLASS = Some(FirstFrame)`) — the kernel-derived leg of the fee decision
//! the design's settlement table reads. It composes over `tcp` for its byte stream;
//! TLS on that stream is core's connection security, never a layer.
//!
//! ## Dialling is not this transport's
//!
//! This transport serves: it binds, accepts and frames what arrives. It does not open a connection
//! to an upstream. [`Transport::dial`](busbar_contract::Transport::dial) answers
//! `AddressRefused` for every destination, before any name is resolved or any socket is opened.
//! An upstream request leaves through the connector, which dials only an IP literal the kernel's
//! one destination judge has passed (`DialJudge`), with this crate's [`door`] framing it. A client
//! of its own here would resolve a name the judge never saw, and would resolve it again on every
//! pooled reconnect (TODO #145).
//!
//! ## Bodies larger than one call
//!
//! A body is not one read's worth of bytes: an accepted request arrives as a HEAD frame followed by
//! body-chunk frames, and is accepted up to the configured maximum however many chunks it took.
//! That maximum is [`ClientSettings::request_body_max_bytes`], carried here from the operator's own
//! `limits.request_body_max_bytes`, the SAME knob the served door's body limit is built from, so
//! the two caps cannot disagree about what this gateway accepts. The ingress reader refuses a
//! declared length past it without reading the body behind it.
//!
//! A request that asks to be told before it uploads is told. `Expect: 100-continue` is what a
//! client sets when it would rather be refused than send a body — `curl` sets it itself past about
//! a kibibyte — and it then waits for the interim answer before writing a byte, so a reader that
//! only parks on the body leaves both sides waiting on each other. The interim answer goes out once
//! the head has passed its framing checks and before the body is waited for.
