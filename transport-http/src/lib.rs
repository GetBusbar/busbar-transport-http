//! The `http` transport: request in, response frames out.
//!
//! `http` carries no session (`SESSION = false`) and its per-frame `WireStatusClass` rides the first
//! response frame (`STATUS_CLASS = Some(FirstFrame)`) — the kernel-derived leg of the fee decision
//! the design's settlement table reads. It composes over `tcp`/`tls` for its byte stream.
//!
//! ## What moved here, byte-identical
//!
//! [`HttpTransport::dial`] builds ONE pooled `hyper_util` client per transport instance, with the
//! exact posture 1.5.5's egress client used (read off that client before this was written; the
//! module is deliberately not named here, because a transport is a wire and names no core path —
//! see this crate's `no_plane_names` test): redirects never followed (hyper's client is structurally incapable of following
//! one — no policy to set), `connect_timeout` 10s, TCP keepalive 60s + nodelay, HTTP/2 keep-alive
//! interval 30s / timeout 10s with the adaptive window on, `pool_max_idle_per_host` /
//! `pool_idle_timeout` from [`ClientSettings`], and `upstream_http1_only` /
//! `upstream_h2_prior_knowledge` selecting the connector's ALPN offer exactly as the engine did.
//! The wait for a response HEAD is bounded too, at [`ClientSettings::request_timeout_secs`] —
//! connect and keepalive were both bounded already; this is the one wait between them that was not.
//!
//! ## Bodies larger than one call
//!
//! [`Transport::dial`]/`listen`/`accept` return an opaque `Conn`; the actual HTTP exchange happens
//! at `write`/`frames`, because the trait carries no request payload at dial time. A body is not
//! one call's worth of bytes, though: the large-body design is a HEAD frame followed by body-chunk
//! frames, and a request body is accepted up to the configured maximum regardless of how many
//! chunks it took. That maximum is [`ClientSettings::request_body_max_bytes`], carried here from
//! the operator's own `limits.request_body_max_bytes` — the SAME knob the served door's body limit
//! is built from, so the two caps cannot disagree about what this gateway accepts. Both
//! accumulators are held to it: the ingress reader refuses a declared length past it without
//! reading the body behind it, and `write`'s pending buffer refuses to grow past it.
//!
//! So `write` ACCUMULATES. Each call appends to the connection's pending message, and the exchange
//! runs when the message is complete and not before — at the declared `Content-Length`, or at the
//! terminal chunk of a chunked body, or immediately for a message that declares neither and
//! therefore carries no body. The reader is the mirror of that: it reads a `Content-Length` body or
//! decodes a chunked one across as many reads as it arrives in, emits one body frame per chunk the
//! sender wrote, and hands the trailer section up as its own final frame rather than folding it
//! into the body. The answer side does the same with an upstream's response trailers, for the same
//! reason: a header that arrived late is still a header.
//!
//! A request that asks to be told before it uploads is told. `Expect: 100-continue` is what a
//! client sets when it would rather be refused than send a body — `curl` sets it itself past about
//! a kibibyte — and it then waits for the interim answer before writing a byte, so a reader that
//! only parks on the body leaves both sides waiting on each other. The interim answer goes out once
//! the head has passed its framing checks and before the body is waited for.
//!
//! ## The response leaves as it arrives
//!
//! The answer to that exchange is a STREAM, and it is handed up as one: the HEAD frame goes out as
//! soon as the response head is in hand, and each body chunk as hyper yields it. That is what makes
//! anything composable over this transport — `sse` re-segments the bytes `http` gives it, so a body
//! withheld until the upstream closed would be one `sse` could not segment until then either, and a
//! stream that never closes would deliver nothing at all. It is also why `write` answers on the
//! head: the caller's write deadline is a deadline on the exchange STARTING, not on an upstream
//! choosing to stop talking.
//!
//! The response body carries a cap of its own, [`ClientSettings::response_body_max_bytes`]. The
//! request cap has the served door above it; a response has nothing above it, and declares no total
//! when it streams — so the cap is held against the bytes that actually arrive, and an upstream past
//! it ends the frame stream rather than growing this node's heap.
