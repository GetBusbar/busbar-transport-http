//! MOUNTING A DECLARED SURFACE: any plane's, and none of them by name.
//!
//! ## What this module is for
//!
//! A protocol served over this transport used to need a crate: the route table, the
//! verb-to-operation map, the media types, the streaming decision and the loop drive all lived
//! beside the codec that knew what the bytes meant, and every new protocol brought another copy of
//! all five. None of those five is about a protocol. They are about how bytes are ADDRESSED, and a
//! plane can declare that — `busbar_contract_transport::surface` is the vocabulary and this module
//! is the reader.
//!
//! So: hand this a [`WireSurface`] and a driver, and it mounts the surface. Which surface it is, it
//! does not know and may not ask. There is no protocol name in this file and none in this crate; the
//! test beside it asserts that over the crate's own source and its own manifest, so the rule is
//! checkable rather than a matter of who reviewed the diff.
//!
//! ## The three steps this module owns, and the one it does not
//!
//! 1. **Address.** [`resolve`] takes what the transport read off the request — the target, the
//!    request method — and finds the operation the declaration says it names, together with the
//!    captures the template yielded and the credential bar the row declares. A target that resolves
//!    to nothing is [`Unaddressed`], which is a 404 and not a refusal: there is no unit, so there is
//!    nothing to refuse.
//! 2. **Publish.** [`published_facts`] builds the fact list this arrival carries: the kernel's own
//!    reserved keys FIRST, then whatever captures the template yielded under their declared names. A
//!    capture named the same as a reserved key does not shadow it — every location resolved further
//!    in is resolved against these, and a request whose `path` fact was not the path would be a
//!    request answered about somewhere else.
//! 3. **Frame the answer.** [`status_of`] maps the closed outcome vocabulary onto this wire's own
//!    numbering, and the media type comes off the declaration. The BYTES are never this module's.
//!
//! And the one it does not: **running the unit.** That is [`UnitDriver::drive`], and everything it
//! takes — the arena, the context, the plane call, the loop, the ending, the ledger — is on the far
//! side of that seam. See `busbar_contract_transport::driver` for why the tree draws it there and
//! not here: core drives plugins, and a transport that called the loop would be a plugin naming
//! core.
//!
//! ## What this transport therefore does NOT know
//!
//! Which plane answered. What the unit cost. What step refused it, if one did. Whether an arena was
//! exhausted. It knows that bytes arrived, which declared address they named, and — from the eight
//! words the driver answers with — which status its own wire should put on the way out.
